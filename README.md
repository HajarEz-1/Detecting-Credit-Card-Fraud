# Detecting Credit Card Fraud

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution for credit card fraud detection, addressing one of the most critical challenges in the financial technology sector. With the rapid growth of digital payments and e-commerce, particularly accelerated by global shifts in consumer behavior, fraud detection systems have become more crucial than ever.

## Project Significance
Credit card fraud results in billions of dollars in losses annually worldwide. In 2024, as digital transactions continue to surge, the importance of robust fraud detection systems has never been greater. This project demonstrates modern approaches to detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning, incorporating best practices for handling imbalanced datasets and sensitive financial data.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from a collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (MLG) of Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). This collaboration represents a bridge between industry and academia, focusing on real-world applications of big data mining and fraud detection.
